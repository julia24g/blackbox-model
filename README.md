# Python Black Box Model of Air-Air Heat Pump
This Python model simulates the black box model of air-air heat pump developed by the Free Appropriate Sustainable Technology (FAST) research team at Western University. It allows a user to input temperatures and heating demand on the coldest day of the year, and outputs COP and heating capacity of the pump.
