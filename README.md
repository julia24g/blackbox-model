# Python Black Box Model of Air-Air Heat Pump
This Python model simulates the black box model of air-air heat pump developed by the Free Appropriate Sustainable Technology (FAST) research team at Western University. It allows a user to input temperatures and heating demand on the coldest day of the year, and outputs COP and heating capacity of the pump.

# Heating
The heating.py file uses the heating equations from the Blackbox Model Report. To run this file, all you need to do is click Run. 

# Cooling
The cooling.py uses the cooling equations from the Blackbox Model Report. To run this file, all you need to do is click Run. The cooling file does not work by running yet.
